# 🏠 Housing Prices Prediction - Regression Problem

**Housing-Prices-Prediction** is a Python-based project designed to predict **housing prices** using regression techniques. It leverages **data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models** to accurately estimate house prices based on features like area, bedrooms, and furnishing status.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- Predicts **house prices** using regression models
- Performs **data preprocessing** (outlier removal, categorical encoding)
- Conducts **EDA** with visualizations (histograms, heatmaps, scatter plots)
- Implements **feature engineering** (e.g., `room_ratio`, `total_rooms`)
- Evaluates models with **RMSE** and **R² Score**
- Saves results for easy analysis

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Python 3** – Core language
- **NumPy, Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models and metrics

## 📂 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/EhsanSamy/Housing-Prices-Prediction.git]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Add advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting)
- Implement **hyperparameter tuning** for better performance
- Introduce **cross-validation** for robust evaluation

---

## 📌 Why This Project?
Manually predicting housing prices or analyzing real estate data is **time-consuming and complex**. This project **automates the process**, providing a streamlined workflow for researchers, data scientists, and real estate professionals to **predict prices** and **understand key factors** influencing house values.
